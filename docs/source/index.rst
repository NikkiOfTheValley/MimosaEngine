MimosaEngine documentation
==========================

MimosaEngine is a game engine designed by NikkiOfTheValley. Most of it 
was not written with others in mind. As such, it is not reccomended for commercial projects.

Its features include, but are not limited to:

* A module-oriented design
* A physics engine
* Networking
* A basic UI handler
* Freetype text rendering

The `GitHub repository <REPO_>`_
contains an example application (at `src/main.cpp <SRCMAIN_>`_), so to use the engine you simply compile
the Visual Studio project and write your application code in main.cpp.
