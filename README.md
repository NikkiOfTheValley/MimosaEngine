# MimosaEngine
MimosaEngine is primarily a game engine for my projects.

## Compiling
At least VS 2019 16.11.0 is required to compile the engine.
Older VS versions might work, but I haven't tested them.

## Libraries
This engine uses the libraries ASIO, GLAD, GLFW, FreeType,
and the Steamworks SDK. All other code, unless stated
otherwise in the file, is under the MIT license stated in
the LICENSE file in the same directory as this README.
Each library has their respective license either in the
file itself or next to the header files in the `vendor/*`
directories.
