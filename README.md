# MimosaEngine
MimosaEngine is primarily a game engine for my projects.

## Compiling
You need CMake, Make, and Clang to compile the engine.
You also need Doxygen, as the docs are generated as part
of the build process.

## Libraries
This engine uses the libraries ASIO, GLAD, GLFW, FreeType,
and the Steamworks SDK. All other code, unless stated
otherwise in the file, is under the MIT license stated in
the LICENSE file in the same directory as this README.
Each library has their respective license either in the
file itself or next to the header files in the `vendor/*`
directories.
